The team is lead by Prof. Marco Springmann. All members contribute to his Wellcome-funded project ["Towards the full cost of diets"](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/towards-full-cost-diets-valuing-and-attributing).

We are working to construct improved estimates of how food systems impact our health and the environment we live in. All our research is global in scope, and is mostly quantitative.
