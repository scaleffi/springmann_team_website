## Research tools

We work with a variety of research tools and methods. 

#### **[The Dietary Impacts Assessment (DIA) model](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2023-8349-48121-71370#:~:text=Download%20(5.3%20MB)-,Overview,of%20diets%20and%20dietary%20change.): a tool for analyzing the health, environmental and affordability implications of dietary change**
- Developed by Marco Springmann and commissioned by WHO Europe
- The tool enables countries to analyse user-specific scenarios of dietary change, and to estimate the health, environmental and cost burden of each scenario in terms of diet costs, avoidable deaths, changes in resource use and compatibility with global environmental targets, including those associated with food-related greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use and fertilizer application.
