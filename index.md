Welcome to our research platform. Here you can keep up to date with our research, and access the data we work with. It also acts as a repository, allowing you to download raw data and supplementary material used in our research.

If you read a publication by Prof. Springmann or one of us and would like to access the data and resources it was built on, please take a look at 
the 'projects' page. If you cannot find the information or data you need, then please feel free to email the most relevant member of the team.
