# Welcome!
This website contains information on projects undertaken by Prof. Marco Springmann and members of his team. It also acts as a repository,
offering users the chance to download raw data and supplementary material used in our research.

If you read a paper by Prof. Springmann or one of us, and would like to access the data and resources it was built on, please take a look at 
the 'projects' page. If you cannot find the information or data you need, then please feel free to email the most relevant member of the team.
