## Welcome

Welcome to the **Springmann Group on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems**. We are a multi-centre research group based at UCL's [Institute for Global Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/igh-centres-0) and the University of Oxford's [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/environment-health).

## Research

Our research focuses on the impacts our diets and food systems have on planetary and public health. Our work is multi-disciplinary, quantitative, and global in scope with [results](https://scaleffi.github.io/webtest-marco-2/research.html) available at national and regional levels. 

Our areas of research include:

**Systems:** Characterisation of diets and food systems that are healthy, environmentally sustainable, and economically just. <br>

**Impacts:** Analysis of how dietary and food-system changes impact human health and the environment. <br>

**Policy options:** Analysis of how health, agricultural, and economic policies affect diets and food systems. <br>
 
## Projects

We work on a variety of funded research [projects](https://scaleffi.github.io/webtest-marco-2/projects.html). 

We are an independent research group and do not accept any funding from the food industry or other bodies that could be perceived to constitute a conflict of interest.
