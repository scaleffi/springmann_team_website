Welcome to the Springmann Group on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems! We are a multi-centre research group based at UCL's [Institute for Global Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/igh-centres-0) and the University of Oxford's [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/environment-health).

Our research focuses on the impacts our diets and food systems have on planetary and public health. We conduct multi-disciplinary systems analysis for characterising, analysing, and developing options for healthy sustainable food systems. Our areas of research include:

-- **Assessments of impacts**: Analysis of the health and food-system impacts of environmental change, including assessments of the full cost of diets
-- **Assessments of the drivers of impacts and co-benefits**: Analysis of how dietary and food-system changes impact human health and the environment
-- **Assessments of policy options**: Analysis of fiscal and other incentives for supporting a transition towards healthy and sustainable food systems

Most of our work is global in scope with results available at national and regional levels. The [data](https://scaleffi.github.io/webtest-marco-2/data.html) tab lists some examples of available data. [Maybe rename the tab as 'Research']
