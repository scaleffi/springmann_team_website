## Welcome

Welcome to the **Springmann Group on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems**. We are a multi-centre research group based at UCL's [Institute for Global Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/igh-centres-0) and the University of Oxford's [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/environment-health).

## Research

Our research focuses on the impacts our diets and food systems have on planetary and public health. Our areas of [research](https://scaleffi.github.io/webtest-marco-2/research.html) include:

- **Systems**: <br>
  Characterisation of diets and food systems that are healthy, environmentally sustainable, and economically just.

- **Impacts**: <br>
  Analysis of how dietary and food-system changes impact human health and the environment.

- **Policy options**: <br>
  Analysis of how health, agricultural, and economic policies affect diets and food systems.

Most of our work is global in scope with [results](https://scaleffi.github.io/webtest-marco-2/research.html) available at national and regional levels.
