This directory contains instructions to generate a webpage for Marco Springmann's research team. 

Ensure there are no index.html files in the repository, which are created when previewing the .md file from within R, or GitHub will deploy that single static page rather than the full website.

The website is automatically redeployed whenever new commits are pushed to the main repository.
